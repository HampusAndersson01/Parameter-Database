<h4 id="code-implementation-and-development">2.6. Code Implementation and Development</h4>

The code implementation and development phase involved translating the design and requirements into functional code for the parameter database system. The development process followed industry best practices, including modular coding, adherence to coding standards, and frequent code reviews.


<h5 id="frontend-development">2.6.1. Frontend Development</h5>

The frontend development focused on implementing the web interface using React and Typescript. Several key components were developed to handle different functionalities within the parameter database system.

The ParameterTable component plays a crucial role in the frontend development of the user-friendly parameter database system. Within this component, the TableRowProps interface is used to define the structure of each table row, encapsulating various properties representing the details of a parameter.

To populate the parameter table with data, the component utilizes the useEffect hook, which triggers a fetch operation from the backend API when a specific condition, denoted by the pendingReload variable, changes. This condition ensures that the data is fetched only when necessary.

![Interface](images/interfaceCode.png)



The code snippet demonstrates the asynchronous data fetching process. The fetch function is used to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints corresponding to the parameters, rig families, and units. The responses are then processed using the .json() method to extract the data.

![Fetch API](images/fetchAPICode.png)


Upon successful retrieval of data, the setData, setRigFamilies, and setUnits functions update the state variables data, rigFamilies, and units, respectively. These state variables, defined using the useState hook, store the fetched data for further use in the component.

In the event of an error during the API request, the code includes error handling using .catch(). Any encountered error is logged to the console for debugging purposes.

Additionally, the finally block ensures that a log message is displayed in the console, indicating the successful completion of the data loading process.

By fetching and storing the necessary data from the API, the ParameterTable component establishes the foundation for rendering the parameter table with up-to-date information. The retrieved data, rigFamilies, and units can be seamlessly integrated into the component's rendering logic to present a comprehensive and user-friendly view of the parameters within the web interface.


<h5 id="backend-development">2.6.2. Backend Development</h5>

The backend development phase of the parameter database system focused on creating a robust API using Node.js and the Express framework. This API serves as the backbone for handling parameter-related operations, enabling seamless communication between the frontend application and the backend server.

To implement the backend functionalities, the following technologies were utilized:

![API](images/apiCode.png)

The provided code snippet showcases the implementation of API routes responsible for handling various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These routes are designed to handle parameter-related operations, allowing clients to interact with the parameter database system effectively.

By utilizing the Express framework, the API routes are organized and structured in a modular manner. The router object is used to define the routes, and each route is associated with a specific endpoint and controller function from the parameters module.

The controller functions, located in the parameters.ts file within the controllers directory, are responsible for processing the incoming requests and generating appropriate responses. These functions interact with the underlying data model to perform operations such as retrieving all parameters, retrieving a parameter by its ID, creating new parameters, updating existing parameters, and deleting parameters.

To enhance the documentation and standardize the API description, Swagger annotations are incorporated within the route definitions. These annotations provide clear descriptions of the API endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the API effectively.

By following best practices and leveraging the power of Node.js and Express, the backend development phase establishes a solid foundation for the parameter database system. The implementation of API routes, along with their corresponding controller functions, ensures smooth communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating seamless parameter management within the application.
